npm run build
npm run test:prod
npm run deploy:staging

# 2. Run staging smoke tests
npm run test:e2e:staging

# 3. Deploy to production
npm run deploy:production

# 4. Run database migrations
npm run db:migrate:prod

# 5. Verify health endpoints
curl https://api.marketsage.com/api/v2/health
```

#### Backend Verification
- [ ] Health endpoint returns 200
- [ ] Database connections established
- [ ] Redis connections working
- [ ] Authentication endpoints responding
- [ ] Core API endpoints functional
- [ ] Metrics collection active

### Phase 2: Frontend Deployment ✅

#### Frontend Deployment Steps
```bash
# 1. Build production bundle
npm run build
npm run analyze-bundle

# 2. Deploy to staging
npm run deploy:staging

# 3. Test critical user flows
npm run test:e2e:staging

# 4. Deploy to production
npm run deploy:production

# 5. Clear CDN cache
npm run cache:clear
```

## Traffic Management

### Blue-Green Deployment Strategy ✅

#### 50% Traffic Split Testing
```bash
# Configure load balancer for 50/50 split
# Old version: 50% traffic
# New version: 50% traffic

# Monitor for 30 minutes:
```

- [ ] Error rates within acceptable range (<0.1%)
- [ ] Response times stable
- [ ] User satisfaction metrics normal
- [ ] No increase in support tickets

#### Full Traffic Cutover
- [ ] Gradually increase traffic to new version

- [ ] Keep old version warm for quick rollback
- [ ] Remove old version after 24-hour stability

### Rollback Procedure ✅
If any issues are detected:

```bash
# Immediate rollback steps
1. Route traffic back to previous version
2. Scale down new deployment
3. Verify old version stability
4. Investigate and document issues
5. Plan hotfix or next deployment
```
