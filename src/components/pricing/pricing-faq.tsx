    question: "Can I switch plans at any time?",
    answer: "Yes! You can upgrade or downgrade your plan at any time. When upgrading, you'll have immediate access to new features. When downgrading, changes take effect at the next billing cycle."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer discounts for Nigerian startups?",
    answer: "Yes, we offer special startup pricing for qualified Nigerian and African startups. Contact our sales team with your CAC documents and startup details to apply for up to 50% discount for the first year."
  },
  {
    question: "What payment methods do you accept?",
    answer: "We accept all major credit cards, bank transfers (Nigerian banks), and popular African payment methods including Paystack, Flutterwave, and Interswitch. For Enterprise plans, we also offer invoicing with NET 30 terms."
  },
  {
    question: "Is there a setup fee?",
    answer: "No setup fees for any plan! Starter and Growth plans include self-service onboarding with video tutorials. Enterprise plans include complimentary white-glove onboarding worth â‚¦500,000."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I pay in USD instead of Naira?",
    answer: "Yes, we offer USD pricing for international customers and Nigerian businesses that prefer dollar billing. Contact our sales team for USD rates which are locked in to protect against currency fluctuations."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if I exceed my plan limits?",
    answer: "We'll notify you when you reach 80% of your limits. You can either upgrade your plan or purchase add-ons for additional contacts or email sends. We never stop your campaigns mid-flight."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer custom plans?",
    answer: "Absolutely! If our standard plans don't fit your needs, we can create a custom package. This is especially common for businesses needing specific features or higher limits without full Enterprise features."
  },
  {
    question: "Is my data safe with MarketSage?",
    answer: "Your data security is our top priority. We use bank-grade encryption, are SOC 2 Type II certified, GDPR compliant, and store data in secure facilities. Enterprise plans can opt for on-premise deployment."
