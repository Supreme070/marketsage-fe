## SLIDE 3: THE FINTECH CHALLENGE
### Why Cross-Border Companies Struggle

#### **Customer Acquisition Crisis**
- 🔥 **$200-500** average customer acquisition cost
- 📉 **2-3%** typical website conversion rate
- ⏰ **21 days** average time to first transaction
- 🤷‍♂️ **70%** drop-off during KYC process

#### **Marketing Blindness**
- ❌ No insight into visitor intent
- ❌ Can't identify high-value prospects
- ❌ Generic messaging to diverse audiences
- ❌ Manual, slow customer onboarding

### Why Current Approaches Don't Work

#### **The Old Way:**
- 📺 Expensive TV/Radio ads

#### **The Result:**
- **85%** of marketing budget wasted
- **3 months** to break even on customer acquisition
- **60%** of signups never complete first transfer
- **Limited** understanding of customer journey
