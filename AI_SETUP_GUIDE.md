# 🧠 MarketSage AI Intelligence Setup Guide

## Achieving GPT-Level Intelligence

MarketSage now supports **real AI intelligence** through OpenAI integration! Here's how to set it up:

## 🚀 Quick Setup (2 minutes)

### Step 1: Get OpenAI API Key
1. Go to [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. Create account or log in
3. Click "Create new secret key"
4. Copy your API key (starts with `sk-`)

### Step 2: Configure MarketSage
Create a `.env.local` file in your project root:

```bash
# OpenAI Configuration (for real AI intelligence)
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-api-key-here

# Database (keep existing)
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://marketsage:marketsage_password@localhost:5432/marketsage?schema=public"

# NextAuth
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-secret-key"
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
```

### Step 3: Restart Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

## ✨ What You Get

### **With OpenAI API Key (Real AI):**
- 🧠 **GPT-4 level intelligence** - Natural conversations
- 💬 **Context awareness** - Remembers conversation history  
- 🎯 **MarketSage expertise** - Deep platform knowledge
- 🌍 **African market insights** - Cultural and regional context
- 📚 **Dynamic responses** - Never the same templated answer

### **Without API Key (Fallback):**
- 🔧 **Smart fallback responses** - Helpful but limited
- ❓ **Question-driven conversations** - Asks clarifying questions
- 📖 **Static guidance** - Useful but not conversational

## 💡 Features Enabled

1. **Intelligent Chat Assistant**
   - Natural conversation flow
   - Contextual responses based on chat history
   - Proactive questions and suggestions

2. **MarketSage Expertise**
   - Email campaign optimization for African markets
   - WhatsApp automation guidance
   - Workflow setup assistance
   - Customer segmentation advice

3. **Memory & Context**
   - Remembers previous conversations
   - Builds on past interactions
   - Provides personalized recommendations

## 🔧 Alternative AI Services

You can also use other AI providers by modifying `src/lib/ai/openai-integration.ts`:

- **Anthropic Claude**: More analytical, better reasoning
- **Groq**: Ultra-fast inference, good for real-time
- **Local LLMs**: For privacy-focused deployments

## 💰 Cost Optimization

OpenAI GPT-4o-mini is very cost-effective:
- ~$0.15 per 1M input tokens
- ~$0.60 per 1M output tokens
- Typical chat: ~500 tokens = $0.0003 (less than a penny)

## 🛡️ Security

- API keys are server-side only
- No data stored with OpenAI beyond requests
- All conversations stored locally in your database
- Full control over your data

## 🚀 Ready to Test?

1. Add your OpenAI API key to `.env.local`
2. Restart the dev server
3. Go to AI Intelligence → Chat
4. Ask: "How can I improve my email campaigns?"

You should now get intelligent, conversational responses instead of templated ones!

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "OpenAI API key not configured"
- Check `.env.local` file exists in project root
- Verify `OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...` format
- Restart development server

### "OpenAI API error"
- Check API key is valid and active
- Verify you have credits in your OpenAI account
- Check rate limits

### Still getting templated responses?
- Check browser developer console for errors
- Verify `.env.local` is loaded (restart server)
- The fallback AI will still work without API key
