## üîß **Deployment Commands**

### **Essential Scripts**

#### **Deployment Control**
```bash
# Check current deployment status
./scripts/deploy-mcp-production.sh status

# Emergency rollback (instant)
./scripts/deploy-mcp-production.sh rollback

# Prepare production environment
./scripts/deploy-mcp-production.sh prepare
```

#### **Health Monitoring**
```bash
# Single health check
npx tsx scripts/monitor-mcp-health.ts check

# Continuous monitoring (60s intervals)
npx tsx scripts/monitor-mcp-health.ts monitor

# Custom monitoring interval
npx tsx scripts/monitor-mcp-health.ts monitor 30
```

#### **Testing & Validation**
```bash
# Test all MCP servers
npm run test:mcp-all

# Test MCP integration
npm run test:mcp-integration

# Test basic MCP functionality
npm run test:mcp
```

## üìä **Monitoring Dashboard**

### **Key Metrics to Track**

#### **Performance Metrics**
- **Response Time**: < 2 seconds (alert threshold)
- **Error Rate**: < 1% (alert threshold)
- **Fallback Usage**: < 50% (alert threshold)
- **AI Accuracy**: > 80% (alert threshold)

#### **Business Metrics**
- **User Experience**: No degradation in app performance
- **AI Quality**: 15-25% improvement in response accuracy
- **Campaign Performance**: Enhanced analytics and insights
- **Customer Intelligence**: Improved segmentation and predictions

#### **System Health**
- **Server Status**: All enabled servers running
- **Database Health**: Fallback mechanisms functioning
- **Memory Usage**: No significant increase
- **CPU Usage**: Within normal operational limits

---

## üö® **Rollback Procedures**

### **Automatic Rollback Triggers**
The system will automatically trigger rollback if:
- **Error rate > 5%** for any period
- **Response time > 5 seconds** consistently
- **Average error rate > 2%** over 5 checks
- **Average response time > 3 seconds** over 5 checks

### **Manual Rollback**
```bash
# Immediate emergency rollback
./scripts/deploy-mcp-production.sh rollback

# Selective server rollback
# Edit .env to disable specific servers:
MCP_CUSTOMER_DATA_ENABLED=false
MCP_CAMPAIGN_ANALYTICS_ENABLED=false
# etc.
```

### **Rollback Verification**
After rollback:
1. **Verify AI systems** using direct database access
2. **Test user functionality** for normal operation
3. **Monitor performance** for stability
4. **Confirm zero impact** on user experience
